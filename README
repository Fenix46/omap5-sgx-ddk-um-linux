*********************************************************************

This is the Texas Instruments Inc (TI) Driver Development Kit (DDK)
for the SGX graphics cores on Linux OMAP platforms. 

This package contains the user mode libraries and binaries for SGX. These
user mode libraries are developed by Imagination Technologies (IMG). TI 
provides additional enhancements and integration for Linux OMAP.

The kernel mode drivers for SGX are available at:
https://git.ti.com/graphics/omap5-sgx-ddk-linux

The OMAP 5430 kernel drivers follow TI's kernel tree hosted at:
http://omapzoom.org/?p=kernel/omap.git

----------
Highlights
----------

This is version 1.9 of the TI DDK. It is based on IMG's
1.9 DDK post-beta engineering drop (ED2253347) delivery to TI.

This release supports Wayland 1.3.0 and DRM/KMS.

DDK dependencies: gcc 4.7.3, glibc 2.15, libdrm 2.4.41, libgbm 9.0.0, Wayland
1.3.0

-----------
Limitations
-----------
1. Supports only DRM/KMS and Wayland. No support for Null Window System
2. Killing Wayland simple-egl example leads to a SGX HW recovery
3. Killing Weston when OpenGL application is running leads to kernel crash
4. Tearing artifacts observed with high render load

----------------
Package Contents
----------------

targetfs/
---------

The 'targetfs' folder contains the user mode modules of SGX DDK for OMAP5/DRA7xx.

*********************************************************************

Consult the TI base system setup documentation for instructions on
setting up your target device including boot loader, kernel, and
Arago filesystem. 


*********************************************************************
*                         INSTALL                                   *
*********************************************************************

The procedure to install the DDK user mode libraries is given below.
Refer to the README in https://git.ti.com/graphics/omap5-sgx-ddk-linux
for building and installing the kernel mode driver.

Untar the package and run the following commands on the host with the 
target filesystem mounted:

host $ export DISCIMAGE=<path_to_target_root_filesystem>
host $ cd <path_to_package>
host $ sudo -E make install

*********************************************************************
*                         LOAD                                      *
*********************************************************************

The procedure to load the DDK kernel drivers is given below. 

--------
OMAP DRM
--------

The omapdrm_pvr driver is expected to be loaded before an OpenGLES 
application can be exercised. The pvrsrvinit handles the loading of the 
necessary DRM driver.

target $ pvrsrvinit

The DDK has been verified using the kmscube test application that has 
been included with the SDK file system. This application uses DRM/KMS
and GBM to render a rotating cube on the screen.

Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the user libraries and Wayland 
libraries.

target $ kmscube

The DDK has been verified using Weston compositor that has been included
with the SDK file system. This application uses Wayland.

target $ weston --connector=4 --tty=1
